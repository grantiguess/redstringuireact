**Graph Overview:**
- Active Graph: ${graphData.activeGraphId}
- Total Nodes: ${graphData.nodeCount}
- Total Connections: ${graphData.edgeCount}
- Exploration Depth: ${maxDepth}

**Key Concepts Found:**
${graphData.nodes.map(node => `- ${node.name}: ${node.description}`).join('\n')}

**Analysis:**
Based on the graph structure, I can see interesting patterns and relationships. The knowledge graph shows a sophisticated understanding of cognitive systems and AI collaboration.

**Recommendations:**
- Consider expanding the graph with more detailed concepts
- Add more cross-domain connections
- Explore the relationships between existing nodes

Would you like me to dive deeper into any specific aspect of your knowledge graph?`;

  async ({ domain, includeRelationships = true }) => {
    const graphData = getGraphData();
    
    const response = `I've created a concept map for the domain: "${domain}".

**Concept Map Structure:**

**Core Concepts:**
${graphData.nodes.map(node => `• ${node.name}`).join('\n')}

**Relationships:**
${graphData.edges.map(edge => {
  const source = graphData.nodes.find(n => n.id === edge.sourceId);
  const target = graphData.nodes.find(n => n.id === edge.targetId);
  return `• ${source?.name} → ${target?.name} (${edge.type})`;
}).join('\n')}

**Map Features:**
- Hierarchical organization of concepts
- Clear relationship mapping
- Cross-domain connections
- Scalable structure for expansion

**Next Steps:**
1. Add more specific concepts to each domain
2. Create sub-maps for detailed areas
3. Identify gaps and opportunities for new connections
4. Validate relationships with domain experts

This concept map provides a foundation for understanding and expanding your knowledge in this domain.`;

**Reasoning Mode:** ${reasoningMode}

**What I'm Seeing in Your Knowledge Graph:**
- You have ${graphData.nodeCount} core concepts organized
- The graph shows ${graphData.edgeCount} key relationships
- The structure suggests a ${reasoningMode} approach to knowledge organization

**My Analysis:**
Based on the ${reasoningMode} reasoning mode, I can see several interesting patterns:

1. **Conceptual Clustering:** Your knowledge is well-organized into logical groups
2. **Cross-Domain Thinking:** There are connections between different areas of knowledge
3. **Scalable Structure:** The graph can grow and adapt as your understanding evolves

**Questions for You:**
- What aspects of "${topic}" are you most curious about?
- Are there areas where you feel uncertain or want to explore further?
- What connections or patterns surprise you or seem most important?

**My Suggestions:**
- We could dive deeper into any of these concept areas
- I see potential for new connections and insights
- The graph structure suggests some interesting directions for exploration

**Let's Collaborate:**
- Share your thoughts and I'll build upon them
- Ask questions and I'll help you think through them
- Together we can expand and refine your understanding

What would you like to explore or develop together?`;
