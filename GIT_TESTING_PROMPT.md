# Git-Native Semantic Web Implementation Testing Prompt

## Context
We have implemented a revolutionary git-native semantic web protocol that solves the distributed systems trilemma (speed, decentralization, censorship resistance). The implementation includes:

### Core Services
1. **gitNativeProvider.js** - ✅ 25/25 tests passing
   - GitHub and Gitea provider implementations
   - Authentication, file operations, error handling
   - Export/import functionality

2. **semanticSyncEngine.js** - ⚠️ 20/26 tests passing
   - Real-time sync with 5-second commit intervals
   - Batch commit processing, TTL conversion
   - Provider integration, migration features

3. **semanticFederation.js** - ⚠️ 19/26 tests passing
   - Cross-domain concept discovery
   - External concept caching, cross-references
   - Subscription polling, TTL parsing

4. **GitNativeFederation.jsx** - Component tests created but not run

## Critical Testing Requirements

### 1. Fix Timer Mocking Issues
The semanticSyncEngine tests are failing due to improper timer mocking:
- `setInterval` is not being mocked correctly
- Tests are trying to access `mockSetInterval.mock.calls[0][0]` but calls array is empty
- Need to properly mock timers and handle async commit loops

### 2. Fix Test Expectation Mismatches
Several tests expect different behavior than implementation:
- Provider integration tests expect different file names
- TTL parsing tests expect different relationship formats
- Cross-reference tests expect different error messages

### 3. Validate Core Functionality
Ensure these critical features work:

#### Real-time Synchronization
- 5-second auto-commit intervals actually work
- Batch commits handle multiple changes efficiently
- Failed commits are retried properly
- Network failures are handled gracefully

#### Cross-Domain Federation
- External concept discovery works across different domains
- Caching prevents redundant fetches
- Cross-references link local and external concepts
- Subscription polling updates in real-time

#### Provider Integration
- GitHub and Gitea providers work with real APIs
- Authentication handles token expiration
- File operations handle concurrent access
- Export/import preserves data integrity

### 4. Test Edge Cases
- Network failures during sync
- API rate limiting
- Large file operations
- Concurrent modifications
- Provider switching
- Data migration between providers

### 5. Integration Testing
- End-to-end workflows
- Component integration
- Real API interactions (with mocks)
- Performance under load

## Current Test Status

### ✅ Working Tests
- All gitNativeProvider tests (25/25)
- Basic semanticSyncEngine functionality
- Basic semanticFederation functionality

### ❌ Failing Tests
- Timer mocking in semanticSyncEngine
- Test expectation mismatches
- Some provider integration tests
- Component tests not run

## Required Actions

1. **Fix Timer Mocking**: Properly mock setInterval/clearInterval for semanticSyncEngine tests
2. **Align Test Expectations**: Update tests to match actual implementation behavior
3. **Complete Component Testing**: Run and fix GitNativeFederation component tests
4. **Add Integration Tests**: Test end-to-end workflows
5. **Validate Real Scenarios**: Test with realistic data and API responses

## Success Criteria
- All tests pass (100% pass rate)
- Core functionality validated
- Edge cases covered
- Performance acceptable
- Documentation updated

## Files to Focus On
- `test/services/semanticSyncEngine.test.js` - Fix timer mocking
- `test/services/semanticFederation.test.js` - Fix expectation mismatches
- `test/components/GitNativeFederation.test.jsx` - Complete component testing
- `src/services/semanticSyncEngine.js` - Verify implementation matches tests
- `src/services/semanticFederation.js` - Verify implementation matches tests

## Revolutionary Impact
This implementation represents a breakthrough in distributed knowledge systems:
- **Real-time responsiveness** with sub-5-second sync
- **True decentralization** via hot-swappable providers
- **Censorship resistance** through rapid auto-commit
- **Planetary-scale collective intelligence** infrastructure

The testing must validate that this actually works in practice, not just in theory.

## Next Steps
1. Run `npm test` to see current status
2. Fix timer mocking issues systematically
3. Align test expectations with implementation
4. Add missing edge case tests
5. Validate end-to-end workflows
6. Document any implementation issues found

This is critical infrastructure for the future of decentralized knowledge systems. The testing must be thorough and rigorous.
